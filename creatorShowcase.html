										<h2><a>Meet our Featured Creator</a></h2>
										<p>
											Alfie Rostron is a passionate student film director. Take a look into his work.
										</p>
									</header>
									<a class="image featured"><img src="images/alfie.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										Alfie Rostron is a film director who controls a film's artisitic and dramatic aspects and visualizes the 
										screenplay while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfilment of that vision. Alfie, plays a key
										role in choosing the cast members, production design and all the creative aspects of filmaking. 
									</p>

											<h3>Work Experience</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Alfie has worked on numerous students films, currently he is working on a feature film with a multitude of other creators. 
											This film which is known as Paul Moxley the detective, serves to be a thrilling crime short movie, that depicts the dangerous life 
											of a Radio Host and the FBI. Alfie, has displayed his skills immensely as he commanded a variety of characters to create an immaculate 
											film set for a wide screen. Furthermore, Alfie has also displayed skills in other categories so he is adapatable to whatever is neccessary.
										</p>
										<p>
											Alfie states "I'd learn about four aspects for directing. 1.) Working with actors, understanding the language to communicate with them, 
											2.) Study screenplays, learn to break them down and learn how to write too, 3.) Understand the world of editing, and 4.) Study cinematography, 
											shots, movements and lenses. Being a director is all about communication, having the ability to get your vision across to everyone not just actors 
											is very important but actors and the DP are the ones you work with the most as a director. Write some shorts, get some people you trust to read them 
											get feedback, get it to where your comfortable, build a team of actors, crew, budget it and then go shoot it. Get feedback from the finished product 
											and move forward from that. Finally if you write, write what you know, topics you understand and it will show in your product when its done. 
											All the best on your journey."
